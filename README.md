Python code to approximate solutions of differential equations of the form $$ y'(t) = (-1/\epsilon)Ay(t) + g(y(t)) $$ where $A$ is a symnetric matrix with positive eigenvalues. An integral method based on Duhamel's formula and Forward Euler method is used in order to get a first order numerical schemr, uniformly accurate w.r.t. $\epsilon$.
